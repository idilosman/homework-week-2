Responsive Portfolio Homework

In this assigment i created a simple portfolio.
In this portfolio you will find a clear navigation bar and home page that explains what the site is about. You will also find a display image of me.
I have included a project i previously submitted and a linked it to the page of my previous homework. I only used CSS styling and HTML to create this site. To make the site accessible to all devices i have included media queries. Lastly i added links to my social media.
